- [ ] Test with 2-3 regional languages (e.g., Telugu, Tamil, Bengali)
- [ ] Verify automatic language detection from speech input
- [ ] Tune response quality for Indian rural context
- [ ] Document supported languages and accuracy metrics

#### 4. Update Agent Personality
- [ ] Modify agent instructions for rural Indian context
- [ ] Add awareness of government services and schemes
- [ ] Update conversation style for low-literacy users
- [ ] Test conversational flow with sample rural scenarios

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Gemini Live successfully integrated with LiveKit Agents
- [ ] Automatic dialect detection working for Hindi + 2 languages
- [ ] Agent responds appropriately in detected language
- [ ] Basic conversation flow functional

## Phase 2: Search Tool Integration (Week 3)
**Goal**: Add web search capability for government information

### Tasks

#### 1. Implement Search Tool
- [ ] Add search tool to agent configuration in `agent.ts`
- [ ] Configure web search API (Google Custom Search API or similar)
- [ ] Implement tool calling in Gemini Live agent
- [ ] Add search result filtering and formatting

#### 2. Government Data Focus
- [ ] Prioritize reliable government sources (gov.in domains)
- [ ] Implement result filtering for authenticity
- [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed information
- [ ] Test search queries for common government schemes

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent can search for government information via tool calls
- [ ] Results filtered to official government sources
- [ ] Search responses integrated into conversation flow

## Phase 3: RAG System (Week 4)
**Goal**: Build retrieval-augmented generation for verified government data

### Tasks

#### 1. Knowledge Base Setup
- [ ] Collect government scheme documents and PDFs
- [ ] Set up vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or ChromaDB)
- [ ] Create embeddings for government content using Gemini
- [ ] Build ingestion pipeline for new government documents

#### 2. RAG Pipeline
- [ ] Implement retrieval system with semantic search
- [ ] Integrate retrieval results with Gemini for context-aware responses
- [ ] Add source attribution for retrieved information
- [ ] Test accuracy against verified government sources

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Agent can retrieve verified information from knowledge base
- [ ] Responses include source attribution
- [ ] RAG improves accuracy over search-only approach

## Phase 4: Demo Preparation (Week 5)
**Goal**: Polish for hackathon demo

### Tasks

#### 1. UI Customization
- [ ] Update branding for "Crunch Caller Module" in `frontend/app-config.ts`
- [ ] Add Indian government color scheme (saffron, white, green)
- [ ] Localize UI text to Hindi/English bilingual
- [ ] Update welcome screen with rural context

#### 2. Demo Scenarios
- [ ] Implement PM Kisan scheme query handling
- [ ] Add loan eligibility question responses
- [ ] Create government contact information database
- [ ] Build officer transfer simulation (mock for demo)

#### 3. Performance Testing
- [ ] Test with simulated poor connectivity (throttling)
- [ ] Validate dialect recognition accuracy (>90%)
- [ ] Stress test with 10-20 concurrent conversations
- [ ] Measure response latency for rural network conditions

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Demo handles all target scenarios smoothly
- [ ] UI reflects Crunch Caller Module branding and rural context
- [ ] System stable under concurrent load
- [ ] Dialect recognition accurate for demo languages

## Future Phases (Post-Hackathon)

### Phase 5: Telephony Integration
- [ ] Exotel API integration for toll-free numbers
- [ ] SMS fallback for areas without voice coverage
- [ ] Multi-channel support (WhatsApp, IVR)

### Phase 6: Government API Direct Integration
- [ ] UIDAI Aadhaar verification integration
- [ ] PFMS payment status checking
- [ ] CSC portal integration for local services

### Phase 7: Officer Directory & Warm Transfers
- [ ] Build comprehensive officer contact database
- [ ] Implement real-time officer availability checking
- [ ] Develop warm transfer functionality with context passing

### Phase 8: Advanced Features
- [ ] Offline PWA capabilities
- [ ] Multi-modal responses (voice + SMS)
- [ ] Analytics dashboard for government insights

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
- [ ] Error handling for API failures and network issues
- [ ] Rate limiting for search and API requests
- [ ] Input sanitization for user queries
- [ ] Logging and monitoring setup

### Medium Priority
- [ ] Caching strategy for government data
- [ ] Security audit for government data handling
- [ ] Performance optimization for rural networks
- [ ] Database schema for user sessions

### Low Priority
- [ ] Code splitting for faster frontend loading
- [ ] Automated testing for dialect detection
- [ ] Internationalization for additional languages
- [ ] Accessibility improvements for screen readers

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Gemini Live quota limits**: Monitor usage, implement caching
- **Network instability**: Add retry logic, offline capabilities
- **Dialect accuracy**: Collect user feedback, iterate on prompts

### Operational Risks
- **Government API access**: Start with public data, build partnerships
- **Regulatory compliance**: Consult legal experts for PDPB compliance
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from day one

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Dialect recognition accuracy: >90%
- Response accuracy for government queries: >95%
- Average response latency: <3 seconds
- System uptime: >99.5%

### User Experience Metrics
- User satisfaction score: >4.5/5 in demo testing
- Task completion rate: >85% for common queries
- Error recovery rate: >90% for failed interactions

### Business Impact Metrics
- Potential user reach: 330M rural Indians
- Time saved per user interaction: 30+ minutes
- Cost reduction vs physical visits: ₹200-500 per user
- Corruption reduction through transparency

## Resources Needed

### Development Team
- 1 AI/ML Engineer (Gemini Live, RAG expertise)
